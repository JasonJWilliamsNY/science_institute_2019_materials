# Mitochondrial DNA and DNA Basics

#### Week of : October 28, 2019


### Important Concepts

* DNA is the molecule of heredity
* Mitochondria have DNA that is distinct from nuclear DNA
* Mitochondrial DNA can inform us about human origins and relationships
* We can use molecular biology to examine mitochondrial DNA


### Review Pre-Questions

Before reviewing the materials below, answer the following questions.

1. In 3-4 sentences, how would you explain DNA to some one who does not know much
   much (or anything) about it?
2. How do you think DNA was discovered? List any facts you recall
3. What, if anything differentiates mitochondrial DNA from nuclear DNA?

### Important terms

* DNA
* Mitochondrial DNA
* DNA Extraction
* Endosymbiont theory
* Mutation
* DNA Sequencing


### Resources to review

Before answering the post question, here are some resources you should review:

1. Inner life of the Cell - mitochondria
   This video gives a beautiful and realistic portrayal of the inner-workings
   of the cell: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkYEYjintqU)

2. DNA From the Beginning
   These are key concepts and basics from this history of DNA and its discovery.
   Please review the following concepts (you only need to go through the 'concept'
   and 'animation' links at the top of each page):
   - [DNA and proteins are key molecules of the cell nucleus](http://dnaftb.org/15/av.html)
   - [A gene is made of DNA](http://dnaftb.org/17/)
   - [A gene is a discrete sequence of DNA nucleotides](http://dnaftb.org/23/)

3. Chromosome (24) mtDNA - Lynn Margulis and the mitochondrial DNA
   This video gives a nice explanation of mitochondrial DNA basics [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru7Wyt778QQ)
   

4. Bonus: If you have time, our next topic will be PCR which you can preview here:


### Post-Questions

Please answer the following post-lecture questions.

4. Why do some scientists think mitochondria have their own DNA?
5. What can studying mitochondrial DNA tell us about human relationships?
6. What techniques of molecular biology allow us to examine mitochondrial DNA?
