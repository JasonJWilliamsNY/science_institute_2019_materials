# Virtual lab - Human Genetic Variation and PTC Testing

## Summary

In this virtual class, we will take a first look at how genotype
and phenotype are related by examining a trait - our ability to
taste bitter substances.

**Due Date:** Submit answers to your questions by 5:00PM 02/10 (i.e. have this done before our next class). Although this assignment is not graded, do the best you can to answer all questions. The video link is approximately 15 minutes. Answering questions and reviewing the resources should 30-45 minutes.

### Pre-lecture questions

From your knowledge of biology (e.g. without looking up any
additional information, and before watching the lecture recording) answer the following questions to
the best of your ability. These are not graded, but are designed
to start you thinking about the topics.

1. What is a trait?
2. How does DNA relate to our traits?
3. Why do different people have different traits?
