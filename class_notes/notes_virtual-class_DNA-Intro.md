# Virtual Class - DNA and DNA Basics


### Important Concepts

* Metacognition: Mental models and ([Mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map))
* DNA is the molecule of life
* We can understand DNA at a variety of levels (chemical, biological, information)
* DNA encodes information that makes proteins


### Virtual class assignments

For virtual classes, there will be some combination of a short video(s),
reading materials, or online activities and a few questions. You will be
responsible for reviewing the assigned materials which usually will take around
an hour or less. Assignments are due by Monday the following week.

**Materials assigned in virtual class will be included in quiz questions**

You can come back to these materials any time for review. Questions for the
virtual class **are not graded** - you only get credit for completing the
assignment and we will review or correct in class.

### Pre-Questions

Before reviewing the materials below, answer the following questions.

1. In 3-4 sentences, how would you explain DNA to some one who does not know much
   much (or anything) about it?



### Important terms

* DNA
* Nucleotide
* Protein
* Chromosome

### Resources to review

These are some suggested online resources to browse. You don't need to look
at every resource, although they may help with the post questions.

1. Inner life of the Cell
   This video gives a beautiful and realsitic portrayal of the inner-workings
   of the cell: [link](https://youtu.be/B_zD3NxSsD8)

2. DNA From the Beginning
   These are key concepts and basics from this history of DNA and its discovery.
   Please review the following concepts (you only need to go through the 'concept'
   and 'animation' links at the top of each page):
   - [DNA and proteins are key molecules of the cell nucleus](http://dnaftb.org/15/av.html)
   - [A gene is made of DNA](http://dnaftb.org/17/)
   - [A gene is a discrete sequence of DNA nucleotides](http://dnaftb.org/23/)


### Post-Questions

Please answer the following post-lecture questions:

2. How would you re-write your original 3-4 sentence description of DNA
3. What is the relationship between DNA, RNA, and Protein?


## Handing in your answers.

1. Create a document in your Science Institute shared Google folder:
   Name the document **2019-09-17-Virtual-Class-LASTNAME_First-initial** where
   you substitute your name and initial (e.g. 2019-09-17-Virtual-Class-WILLIAMS_J)
2. Copy the pre- and post-questions (3 total) into the document and answer
   underneath the questions.
3. Make sure to share your document with *williams@yuhsg.org* by next Monday.
