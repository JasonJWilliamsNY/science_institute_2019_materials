# Introduction to Measurements

#### Week of : September 17, 2017


### Important Concepts

* Metacognition ([Mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)/Learning by conceptualization)*
* Quantitative vs. Qualitative
* Sterile technique
* Accuracy/Precision
* Error (in observation)

### Important terms

* microliters/milliliters/liters
* Micropipette
* Pipette tubes
* Cross-contamination


* You will not be quizzed on metacognition terms. 

### Post-Class Review

Most note sheets will come with a list of important terms and concepts. Your notes from the class should (and hopefully always will) contain enough information for you to successfully define these terms. Go through your notes and fill in any missing definitions. If you have questions ask. The terms and concepts will almost certainly be used in quizzes/assignments and so you need to know them. 


## Measurement in the lab. 

**"Measure what can be measured, and make measurable what cannot be measured" - Galileo**

Measurement is a cornerstone of scientific technique. What we will introduce in this class are some of the basic tools and techniques of measurement in the molecular biology lab. We will not cover all the possible techniques today, but will get an introduction to key pieces of equipment and how to use them properly. Throughout the course, we will work on developing your effective use of the equipment, as well as your understanding into why we use these techniques.
