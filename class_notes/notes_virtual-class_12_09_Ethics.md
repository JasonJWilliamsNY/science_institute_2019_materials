## The Ethics of DNA

#### Week of December 9th, 2019

In this virtual class, we will explore the idea of ethics as it relates to our work in the lab. 

### Homework
Answer pre- lecture questions/Vocabulary and complete the short essay. 

**Time:** Including viewing the lectures, listening activities, questions, and reading, this should require 60-120 minutes of time. Think about doing most of this during the time of our normal class. 


**Pre-Lecture Questions:**
Before looking at the materials, give one- or two-sentence answers to the following questions. Just give your best answer - 'right' or 'wrong' does not matter here. 

1. What is "ethics"?
2. As you have learned different subjects in school (math, writing, science, etc.) have you ever been asked if the skills you learned (addition, persuasive essay writing, how to extract DNA) is ethical, or related to ethics?

**Pre-Lecture Vocabulary:**

Find definitions for the following terms. Please attempt to state the definitions in your own words:

1. Ethics
2. Informed consent
3. Institutional Review Board
4. Genetic counseling
5. GINA (Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act)
6. Eugenics

**Lecture:**

This lecture is a powerful one, and although I have a lot to say, I am not recording a video for this lecture. Instead, I'd like you to spend a few minutes listening to the following stories and forming your own opinions. We will discuss in class. 

- The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: [Podcast, ~26 minutes](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91716-henriettas-tumor/)
- the ethics of dna use: [3 podcasts, ~15 minutes total listening](http://www.npr.org/series/17128722/the-ethics-of-dna-use)


**Post-lecture Short Essay:**

Based on the information in the podcasts, and information you can find online (from your vocabulary search, and the resource links below), compose a short essay answer (1/2 page or less) in response to the following statement:

**An individual has the absolute right to keep their DNA information private.**

Form an opinion (for or against this statement), and develop 2-3 reasons to defend your position. Thinking of this exercise as a hypothetical debate, there is no expectation that the position you choose to argue for in your debate is your personal opinion. You may  (and are encouraged to) choose a position that is the opposite of your own personal opinion. This is a chance to explore a view alternative to your own.

## Quiz III

We will have a quiz on Thursday Dec. 17th. We will review in class on Monday. 



**Here are the key items and study points you should review for the quiz:**


- You should be able to define and explain:

    -   Why PCR is a useful technique in molecular biology
    - What the stages of the PCR process are and what happens at each stage (e.g. Denature, anneal, extend)
    - What the chemical components of PCR are (e.g. polymerase, primer, template DNA, etc.) and what their purpose is. 
    - What are the chemical components of DNA sequencing (e.g. polymerase, dideoxynuclotides, primer, template DNA, etc.) 
    - You should understand what makes PCR and Sequencing similar and different e.g.: 
    
        - PCR amplifies a specific sequence of DNA
        - DNA sequencing allows you to analyze the sequence of DNA that has been amplified by PCR
        - PCR uses two primers to amplify DNA
        - Sequencing uses one primer
        - PCR uses dNTPs (regular set of nucleotides)
        - Sequencing also uses ddNTPs (dideoxynuclotides) which give rise to sequences of DNA that end in a colored (fluorescent) nuclotide. 
    - Phred score
    - (SNP)Mutation


**Extended questions**

Beyond recalling the facts of PCR and DNA sequencing, you should be able to answer questions like these: 


- What is the difference between raw data and processed data
- How do we report on the accuracy of DNA sequence
