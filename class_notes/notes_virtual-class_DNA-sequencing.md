# Virtual Class - DNA Sequencing


## Summary

In this virtual class, we will delve into DNA sequencing, an important technology in molecular biology. Using [Sanger sequencing](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) we took the products of the mitochondria DNA experiment and revealed the actual sequence of nucleotides in your DNA. We will review how this technology works, and you will answer some pre- and post-lecture questions. 

**Due Date:** Submit answers to your questions by 7:00PM 10/30. Although this assignment is not graded, do the best you can to answer all questions. The video link is approximately 15 minutes. Answering questions and reviewing the resources should 30-45 minutes. 

### Pre-questions

Before watching the video, answer the following questions. 

- What is a genome?
- Any measurement (including DNA sequencing) is subject to error (e.g. in a DNA sequencing report perhaps an 'A' was misread as a 'T', a 'C' as an 'A', etc. When taking a measurement, can you think of a way to reduce or eliminate error?

### Post lecture questions

1. How do we report error (uncertainty) in a DNA sequence?
2.  What modified nucleotides are added to the sequencing reaction and in what two ways do they differ from regular DNA nucleotides? 
3. How long did it take to sequence the first human genome, and how much did it cost? How have the speed and costs of genome sequencing changed recently?

Additional Question (see the reading link):

4.  What is a SNP?
