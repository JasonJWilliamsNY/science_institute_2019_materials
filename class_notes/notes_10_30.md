# Virtual lab - Bioinformatics analysis of Mitochondrial DNA

## Summary

In this virtual class, we will take a first look at analyzing your mitochondrial DNA results using [DNA Subway](https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/). The analysis of biological data (such as your DNA sequence) is an area of biology called [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) and is an important component of doing research. 

**Due Date:** Submit answers to your questions by 5:00PM 11/6 (i.e. have this done before our next class). Although this assignment is not graded, do the best you can to answer all questions. The video link is approximately 15 minutes. Answering questions and reviewing the resources should 30-45 minutes.

### Virtual Laboratory Exercise: Examine your mitochondrial DNA

**Pre-requisite:** You must sign up for a CyVerse account and request access to **DNA Subway**:

1. Visit the user portal at: [https://user.cyverse.org/](https://user.cyverse.org/)
2. Register for a CyVerse account using your YUHSG email account
3. Check your email for an account confirmation link and follow the confirmation instructions. 
4. Log in to [User Management](https://user.cyverse.org/dashboard/) and open the Apps & Services tab.
5. Go to the Available Services section at the bottom.
6. Find "DNA Subway" and click Request Access. 
7. You may need to fill in some information and you can indicate that you are using DNA Subway in School. 

**Note:** If you have trouble with anything in the registration process please email me. If there are difficulties, you will still be able to use DNA Subway as a guest until we resolve the issue. 

#### Analyzing MT DNA with DNA Subway

##### Viewing Sequence

1. Login to [DNA Subway](http://dnasubway.iplantcollaborative.org/) using your CyVerse account. If you have trouble getting an account, you can click 'Enter as Guest'
2. Once you are logged in click the blue square 'Determine Sequence Relationships'
3. Under 'Select Project Type' choose 'mtDNA'
4. Under 'Select Sequence Source' choose 'Import trace files from DNALC'
5. Select the entry for tracking number **30-30612517**, 10/07/2017, Jason Williams. 
6. Click 'Select All' to add the available sequences, then click 'Add selected files.'
7. Under 'Name Your Project' enter "Mitochondrial DNA Lab, Oct. 2017", then click 'Continue'
8. On the DNA Subway screen you will see various analysis steps, click on 'Sequence Viewer' to view your DNA Sequence. 
9. Clicking on the name of any sequence in the Sequence Viewer will allow you to view that sequence's chromatogram readout. Answer lab question 1
10. Exit the 'Sequence Viewer' window

##### Cleaning Sequence

1. Click on 'Sequence Trimmer' to run the tool, then click again to view the result. Answer lab question 2
2. Exit the 'Sequence Trimmer' window

##### Find Sequence Matches

1. Click on the 'BLAST' tool. 
2. Next to the name of your sequence click 'BLAST'; use the result to answer lab question 3. 
3. Exit the 'BLAST' window

##### Compare sequences


1. Click on 'Select Data'
2. Click on 'Select All' and the click on 'Save Selections'
3. Click on 'MUSCLE' to run the tool, click again to view the results. 
2. In the 'Alignment Viewer' window click 'Trim Alignment'
3. Click on the 'ATGC' box to view details of the sequence comparison. 


Answer the remaining lab questions. 


**Lab Questions:**

1. Approximately how many basepairs of good sequence did your experiment produce?
2. What does the 'Sequence Trimmer' tool do?
3. According to the BLAST tool, what species does your sequence match to?
4. The 'Consensus' sequence in the alignment viewer is the sum of all of the nucleotides we are comparing - e.g. the for every nucleotide, in all of the sequences we are comparing, if an individual sequence and the consensus are the same we see no nucleotide letter in the individual sequences' row. If there is a difference, we will see what nucleotide the sequence has compared to the sequence. 
    a.  What types of changes do you see between the consensus and your sequence? List them all in order by writing what the consensus nucleotide is, and what your nucleotide change is (this question will be demonstrated in our lecture video).
