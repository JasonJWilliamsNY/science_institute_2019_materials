## Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz:** PCR and Genes



**Here are the key items and study points you should review for the quiz:**


- You should be able to define and explain:

    -   Why PCR is a useful technique in molecular biology
    - What the stages of the PCR process are and what happens at each stage (e.g. Denature, anneal, extend)
    - What the chemical components of PCR are (e.g. polymerase, primer, template DNA, etc.) and what their purpose is. 
    - What are the chemical components of DNA sequencing (e.g. polymerase, dideoxynuclotides, primer, template DNA, etc.) 
    - You should understand what makes PCR and Sequencing similar and different e.g.: 
    
        - PCR amplifies a specific sequence of DNA
        - DNA sequencing allows you to analyze the sequence of DNA that has been amplified by PCR
        - PCR uses two primers to amplify DNA
        - Sequencing uses one primer
        - PCR uses dNTPs (regular set of nucleotides)
        - Sequencing also uses ddNTPs (dideoxynuclotides) which give rise to sequences of DNA that end in a colored (fluorescent) nuclotide. 
    - Phred score
    - (SNP)Mutation



You should be able to answer the following. These questions don't have definitive answers, so there will be 1-2 short essay questions with lots of partial credit. 

- Give a definition of a gene

- Explain the relationship between a gene and DNA

- Explain the "Central Dogma" of molecular biology (DNA>mRNA>Protein)
