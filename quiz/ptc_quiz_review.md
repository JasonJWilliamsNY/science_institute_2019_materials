## Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz:** Human Polymorphisms



**Here are the key items and study points you should review for the quiz:**


- You should be able to define and explain:

    -   Why PCR is a useful technique in molecular biology
    - What the stages of the PCR process are and what happens at each stage (e.g. Denature, anneal, extend)
    - What the chemical components of PCR are (e.g. polymerase, primer, template DNA, etc.) and what their purpose is. 
    - What is a polymorphism?
    - What is a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)
    - What are the different types of mutations (e.g. Indel, transition, transversions)
    - What is a restriction enzyme?
    - What is a CAPS marker? 


You should be able to answer the following. These questions don't have definitive answers, so there will be 1-2 short essay questions with lots of partial credit. 

- Explain how we used CAPS makers to detect variations in our PTC tasting gene

- Interpret a gel from a PTC gene experiment (or similar experiment using a CAPS marker)

- Explain the "Central Dogma" of molecular biology (DNA>mRNA>Protein)
