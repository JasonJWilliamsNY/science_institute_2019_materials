**This is your first quiz** so here are some ground rules/instructions.

This quiz is mostly memorization (unfortunately). Be familiar and able to define the following terms. Your study time should be 20-30 minutes. We will have time in class to answer specific questions before the quiz. See our [safety notes](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2019_materials/blob/master/class_notes/notes_09_09.md).

- MSDS (What is it, what is the basic information it tells us)
- PPE (What are some examples of protective equipment)
