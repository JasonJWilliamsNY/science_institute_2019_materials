## Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz:** Bacterial Transformation, Genes, and Mitochondrial DNA


**Vocabulary terms:**

These are some terms you should be able to define/explain for the quiz


- Bacterial transformation 
- Heat shock
- Plasmid 
- Green Flourescent Protein
- Gene
- Exon/Intron
- Mitochondrial DNA 



**Key Concepts**

For the following, you should be able to give a succinct explanation of the concept, including how these techniques work and what their purpose is. These topics will be covered in quiz at the same level covered in class notes. During pre-quiz discussions you can evaluate if you have a sufficient understanding of these topics. 

- Explain how DNA can be introduced into bacteria using heat shock
- Explain how flourescent proteins like green flourescent protein are being used in science research
- Explain what a gene is and how it relates to DNA
- Explain what are some of the parts of a gene (e.g. intron, exon)
- Know some of the properties that distringuishes mitochondrial DNA from nuclear DNA
- Be able to explain the steps of the mitochondrial DNA extraction and what the purpose of the steps are (saline rinse, centrifugation, boiling of cells in chelex)
- Explain the purpose of agarose gel electrophoresis including what are the chemical components and protocols (steps) in this technique
